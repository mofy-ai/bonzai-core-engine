## 🚀 Workflows Explained

### 1. 🧪 Main Production Test Suite
**File:** `bonzai-production-tests.yml`  
**Triggers:** Push to main, PRs, daily schedule, manual

**What it does:**
- Runs your full `PRODUCTION_MASTER_TEST_SUITE.py` 
- Tests all 42+ backend services
- Validates AI model orchestration
- Checks memory systems, integrations, performance
- Runs `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.py` for go/no-go decision

**Test Categories:**
- `ai-models` - All AI provider integrations
- `orchestration` - ZAI Prime supervisor, agent spawning
- `memory-systems` - Neo4j, Qdrant, Redis functionality  
- `integrations` - Scrapybara, Pipedream, WhatsApp
- `performance` - 6x Vertex speed, quota management
- `security` - API key validation, access controls

### 2. 🔍 PR Analysis & Validation
**File:** `pr-analysis.yml`  
**Triggers:** Pull requests

**What it does:**
- Analyzes which files changed in the PR
- Runs targeted tests based on changes
- Security scan for accidentally committed secrets
- Posts detailed analysis report as PR comment

**Smart Testing:**
- **Critical files changed** → Full test suite
- **Test files changed** → Validation testing
- **Docs/config only** → Quick smoke tests

### 3. 🚀 Automated Deployment
**File:** `deploy-production.yml`  
**Triggers:** Successful production tests, manual deployment

**What it does:**
- Pre-deployment validation using your readiness assessment
- Deploys to Railway staging first
- Validates staging deployment
- Promotes to production with approval gates
- Post-deployment monitoring and validation
- Emergency rollback capability

**Deployment Flow:**
1. Pre-deployment readiness check
2. Deploy to staging → validate
3. Deploy to production → validate  
4. 5-minute monitoring period
5. Notification and reporting

### 4. 📊 Continuous Monitoring
**File:** `continuous-monitoring.yml`  
**Triggers:** Scheduled (every 15 min during business hours)

**What it does:**
- Runs health checks using your production test suite
- Tests AI model performance and responsiveness
- Detects mock responses vs real AI calls
- Creates GitHub issues for critical problems
- Stores monitoring data as artifacts

**Monitoring Types:**
- `standard` - Basic health checks
- `deep` - Comprehensive system analysis
- `performance` - Response time and throughput
- `security` - Security posture validation

## 🎮 How to Use

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Trigger full production test suite
gh workflow run "🚀 Bonzai Production Test Suite" 

# Run specific test category
gh workflow run "🚀 Bonzai Production Test Suite" -f test_type=specific

# Quick smoke tests only
gh workflow run "🚀 Bonzai Production Test Suite" -f test_type=quick
```

### Manual Deployment  
```bash
# Deploy to staging
gh workflow run "🚀 Deploy to Production" -f deployment_type=staging

# Deploy to production (requires approval)
gh workflow run "🚀 Deploy to Production" -f deployment_type=production

# Force deployment (bypasses readiness gates)
gh workflow run "🚀 Deploy to Production" -f deployment_type=production -f force_deploy=true
```

### Manual Monitoring
```bash
# Standard health check
gh workflow run "📊 Continuous System Monitoring"

# Deep system analysis  
gh workflow run "📊 Continuous System Monitoring" -f monitoring_type=deep

# Performance monitoring
gh workflow run "📊 Continuous System Monitoring" -f monitoring_type=performance
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Authentication Failed" errors**
- Check GitHub PAT token has correct permissions
- Verify secrets are properly configured

**❌ "Backend unreachable" in tests**  
- Confirm `BONZAI_BACKEND_URL` is correct
- Check Railway deployment status
- Verify backend is actually running

**❌ "Mock responses detected"**
- API keys may be invalid/expired
- Check AI provider quotas
- Review backend logs for errors

**❌ Deployment failures**
- Check Railway token permissions
- Verify environment variables
- Review deployment logs

### Getting Help

1. **Check workflow logs** - Detailed error info in Actions tab
2. **Review artifacts** - Download test results and reports
3. **Monitor system health** - Use continuous monitoring alerts
4. **Manual validation** - Run tests locally to isolate issues

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Create feature branch** → PR triggers validation
2. **Fix any issues** → Re-run tests automatically  
3. **Merge to main** → Full test suite runs
4. **Auto-deploy** → Staging validation → Production

### Monitoring
- **Daily**: Review monitoring alerts and trends
- **Weekly**: Check performance metrics and optimization opportunities  
- **Monthly**: Review security scans and update dependencies

### Security
- **Never commit API keys** - Use GitHub secrets only
- **Regular key rotation** - Update secrets quarterly
- **Monitor for leaks** - Security scans run automatically
