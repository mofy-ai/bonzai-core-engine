## 🏗️ MODE 1: FOUNDATION MODE

### 🎯 Mission Statement

**Get the basic development environment working from broken or new state**

### 📋 When to Enter This Mode

- Starting a completely new project
- Development environment is broken (won't start, compile errors)
- Major dependency issues preventing development
- Setting up development environment on new machine
- After major framework upgrades that broke the environment

### ✅ Allowed Actions

- **Environment Setup**

  - Install required dependencies (`npm install`, `pip install`, etc.)
  - Configure development servers
  - Set up local databases/services
  - Configure environment variables for development
  - Set up IDE/editor configurations

- **Basic Infrastructure**

  - Create basic project structure
  - Set up build tools (webpack, vite, etc.)
  - Configure development scripts
  - Set up hot reload/live reload
  - Configure basic routing

- **Critical Fixes**
  - Fix syntax errors preventing compilation
  - Resolve dependency conflicts
  - Fix configuration issues
  - Address critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### ❌ Strictly Forbidden

- Building new features
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Production configurations
- Complex business logic
- Advanced integrations
- Code refactoring (unless blocking compilation)

### 🔍 Guard Questions

**Before any action, ask:**

- "Does this help the development server start successfully?"
- "Is this fixing a basic infrastructure issue?"
- "Am I adding features or fixing the foundation?"

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Hot reload/live reload works
- [ ] Basic routing functions
- [ ] Can access application in browser
- [ ] Development debugging tools work
- [ ] No critical compilation errors

### ➡️ Transition Guidelines

**Move to BUILD MODE when:**

- All success criteria are met
- Ready to create new features

**Move to COMPLETION MODE when:**

- Foundation works but existing features are incomplete

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Adding features too early**: Resist urge to build before foundation is solid
- **Production focus**: Don't worry about production builds yet
- **Over-optimization**: Don't optimize what isn't working yet

### 💡 Technology Examples

```bash
# Web Development
npm run dev        # Should start cleanly
npm run start      # Alternative start command
yarn dev          # Yarn equivalent

# Python
python manage.py runserver  # Django
flask run                   # Flask

# Mobile
npx react-native start     # React Native
flutter run                 # Flutter
```

### 🔍 Guard Questions

**Before any action, ask:**

- "Am I polishing existing work instead of building?"

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] New features exist and are accessible
- [ ] Basic functionality works (even if rough)

## 📊 Mode Transition Checklist

### Before Switching Modes:

- [ ] Current mode success criteria met
- [ ] No blocking issues in current mode
- [ ] Clear reason for mode switch
- [ ] Next mode makes logical sense
- [ ] Team aligned on mode switch

### Mode Switch Documentation:

```
FROM: [Current Mode]
TO: [New Mode]
REASON: [Why switching]
SUCCESS CRITERIA MET: [List completed criteria]
NEXT OBJECTIVES: [What we'll accomplish in new mode]
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Universal Principles

1. **Stay in mode** - Don't mode-hop until success criteria met
2. **Guard vigilantly** - Always ask mode-specific guard questions
3. **Document transitions** - Record why and when you switch modes
4. **Validate completion** - Ensure mode objectives achieved before switching
5. **Communicate clearly** - Make sure team knows current mode

### Common Anti-Patterns

- **Mode confusion**: Doing Build Mode work while in Completion Mode
- **Premature optimization**: Jumping to Cleanup Mode before Completion
- **Production rush**: Skipping Validation Mode to get to Deployment
- **Feature creep**: Adding scope in any mode except Build/Enhancement

### Success Indicators

- Clear progression through modes
- Consistent completion of mode objectives
- Reduced context switching and confusion
- Better project predictability and timeline adherence
