echo $PATH

# Find where Claude is installed
which claude

# Add to PATH if needed (macOS/Linux)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For Windows, add to System Environment Variables
```

#### Update TrueNorth Configuration

}
```

#### Check System Resources
```bash
# Check memory usage
htop  # Linux/Mac
taskmgr  # Windows

# Check disk space
df -h  # Linux/Mac
dir C:  # Windows
```

#### Review Agent Logs
1. Open TrueNorth Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Agent Logs" section
3. Look for specific error patterns:
   - Memory errors ‚Üí Reduce parallel agents
   - Network errors ‚Üí Check internet connection
   - Permission errors ‚Üí Check file permissions

### 6. Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:
- VS Code becomes slow/unresponsive
- High CPU/memory usage
- System freezing

**Solutions**:

#### Optimize Settings
```json
{
  "truenorth.maxParallelAgents": 4,
  "truenorth.sessionTimeout": 120000,
  "truenorth.enableDetailedLogging": false
}
```

#### Monitor Resource Usage
- Use TrueNorth Dashboard performance tab
- Check VS Code Task Manager: `Help > Show Running Extensions`
- Monitor system resources

#### Performance Tuning
```json
{
  "truenorth.performanceMode": "optimized",
  "truenorth.backgroundProcessing": true,
  "truenorth.memoryLimit": "2GB"
}
```

## üìã Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use TrueNorth without an internet connection?
**A**: No, TrueNorth requires internet access to communicate with Claude's API. However, you can work offline after agents have completed their tasks.

### Q: How much does it cost to run TrueNorth?
**A**: TrueNorth itself is free, but it uses Claude API which has usage-based pricing. Monitor your usage with `claude usage` command.

### Q: Can I run TrueNorth on multiple projects simultaneously?
**A**: Yes, you can open multiple VS Code windows with TrueNorth, but be mindful of resource usage and API rate limits.

### Q: Why are my agents taking so long to complete?
**A**: Agent execution time depends on project complexity and your internet connection. Large projects may take 30+ minutes. Monitor progress in the dashboard.

### Q: Can I cancel running agents?
**A**: Yes, use "TrueNorth: Cancel Execution" command or the stop button in the dashboard.

### Q: What happens if my computer shuts down during agent execution?
**A**: Running agents will be terminated. TrueNorth will detect incomplete tasks on restart and offer to resume or restart them.

### Enable Debug Mode
```json
{
  "truenorth.debugMode": true,
  "truenorth.verboseOutput": true,
