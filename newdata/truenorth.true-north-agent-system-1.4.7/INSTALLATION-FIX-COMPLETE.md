# ‚úÖ TrueNorth v1.3.0 Installation Fix - COMPLETE!

## üö® ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem**: Extension activation failed with directory creation error
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/logs/wave-01/phase1-execution-reports'
```

**Root Cause**: AgentOrchestrator was using `process.cwd()` instead of VS Code workspace path

---

## üîß FIX IMPLEMENTED

### **Changes Made to AgentOrchestrator.ts:**

1. **Added VS Code Import**:
   ```typescript
   import * as vscode from 'vscode';
   ```

2. **Fixed Workspace Path Resolution**:
   ```typescript
   // OLD (broken):
   this.logBasePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'logs', `wave-${this.waveNumber}`);
   
   // NEW (fixed):
   const workspacePath = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0]?.uri?.fsPath || process.cwd();
   this.logBasePath = path.join(workspacePath, 'logs', `wave-${this.waveNumber}`);
   ```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added try-catch blocks for directory creation
   - Fallback to temporary directory if workspace creation fails
   - Graceful degradation if all directory creation fails

4. **Protected Report Generation**:
   - Added checks for empty logBasePath
   - Protected both phase reports and final production report
   - Console logging for debugging directory issues
